					<p>
						"Ulysses" is a poem in blank verse by the Victorian poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892),
						written in 1833 and published in 1842 in his well-received second volume of poetry. An
						oft-quoted poem, it is popularly used to illustrate the dramatic monologue form. Facing old age,
						mythical hero Ulysses describes his discontent and restlessness upon returning to his kingdom,
						Ithaca, after his far-ranging travels. Despite his reunion with his wife Penelope and son
						Telemachus, Ulysses yearns to explore again.
					</p>
					<p>
						<blockquote>
							"And this gray spirit<br>yearning in desire<br>
							To follow knowledge<br>like a sinking star,<br>
							Beyond the utmost bound<br>of human thought."
						</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>
						The character of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The
						adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and
						Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's
						Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is
						condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for his pursuit of knowledge beyond human
						bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.
					</p>
					<p>
						For much of this poem's history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, admiring him for
						his determination "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield". The view that Tennyson
						intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in
						his life—the death of his closest friend—that prompted him to write it. In the twentieth
						century, some new interpretations of "Ulysses" highlighted potential ironies in the poem. They
						argued, for example, that Ulysses wishes to selfishly abandon his kingdom and family, and they
						questioned more positive assessments of Ulysses' character by demonstrating how he resembles
						flawed protagonists in earlier literature.

						<blockquote>
							"This poem is written as a dramatic monologue: the entire poem is spoken by a single
							character, whose identity is revealed by his own words. The lines are in blank verse, or
							unrhymed iambic pentameter, which serves to impart a fluid and natural quality to Ulysses’s
							speech. Many of the lines are enjambed, which means that a thought does not end with the
							line-break; the sentences often end in the middle, rather than the end, of the lines. The
							use of enjambment is appropriate in a poem about pushing forward “beyond the utmost bound of
							human thought.” Finally, the poem is divided into four paragraph-like sections, each of
							which comprises a distinct thematic unit of the poem."

					<h1>It little profits that an idle king,</h1>
					<p>
						By this still hearth, among these barren crags,<br>
						Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole<br>
						Unequal laws unto a savage race,<br>
						That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.<br>
						I cannot rest from travel: I will drink<br>
						Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd<br>
						Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those<br>
						That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when<br>
						Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br>
						Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;<br>
						For always roaming with a hungry heart<br>
						Much have I seen and known; cities of men<br>
						And manners, climates, councils, governments,<br>
						Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;<br>
						And drunk delight of battle with my peers,<br>
						Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.<br>
						I am a part of all that I have met;<br>
						Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'<br>
						Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades<br>
						For ever and forever when I move.<br>
						How dull it is to pause, to make an end,<br>
						To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!<br>
						As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life<br>
						Were all too little, and of one to me<br>
						Little remains: but every hour is saved<br>
						From that eternal silence, something more,<br>
						A bringer of new things; and vile it were<br>
						For some three suns to store and hoard myself,<br>
						And this gray spirit yearning in desire<br>
						To follow knowledge like a sinking star,<br>
						Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

				<div class="verse">
					<h1>This is my son, mine own Telemachus,</h1>
					<p>
						To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,<br>
						Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil<br>
						This labour, by slow prudence to make mild<br>
						A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees<br>
						Subdue them to the useful and the good.<br>
						Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere<br>
						Of common duties, decent not to fail<br>
						In offices of tenderness, and pay<br>
						Meet adoration to my household gods,<br>
						When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
					</p>

				<div class="verse">
					<h1>There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:</h1>
					<p>
						There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,<br>
						Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me -<br>
						That ever with a frolic welcome took<br>
						The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed<br>
						Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;<br>
						Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;<br>
						Death closes all: but something ere the end,<br>
						Some work of noble note, may yet be done,<br>
						Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.<br>
						The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:<br>
						The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep<br>
						Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,<br>
						Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
						Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
						The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
						To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
						Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
						It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br>
						It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
						And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
						Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'<br>
						We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
						Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;<br>
						One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
						Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
						<strong>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</strong>
